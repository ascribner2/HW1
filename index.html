                <p>
                    Black holes are a crazy but interesting phenomena that appear in our universe. 
                    Due to the common ignorance of them, they are constantly used as a shortcut for 
                    any plot hole in stories involving space. They are also the center of numberous
                    theories. Hopefully this short introduction can help clear up some misconceptions
                    about them.

                    <h2>What is a black hole?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A black hole is simpily a singularity, meaning a singular point in space. This point
                        is extremely dense and small, probably infinitely. That density in a small place causes it to
                        have an immense amount of gravity. So a black hole is not a portal to another dimension, it's 
                        nothing more than a lot of mass in a small place. Now one might wonder how a black hole is created.

                    <h2>How black holes are created</h2>
                    <p>
                        Most people don't think twice about how these crazy, completely black, terrors appeared 
                        in our universe, thinking it's probably too confusing. It's actually quite simple, when 
                        you ignore most of the physics behind it. A black hole is created when a star that is big
                        enough reaches the end of it's life and explodes, which is called a supernova. The gravity
                        of the star is so strong that it pulls the contents back into it self. Now if the star is
                        slightly too small it condenses down into a neutron star. Otherwise the force of it collapsing
                        is strong enough to make neutrons get closer than physically possible, once it passes that it just
                        keeps going. Getting infinitely smaller, until you get a sigularity.
                    </p>

                <div class="Point-3">
                    <h2>What would happen if you entered a black hole?</h2>
                    <p>
                        First thing that would happen is that you would be evaporated by the amount of radiation around the 
                        edge of the event horizon of the black hole. The event horizon is the point in a black hole that
                        once it is passed there the is no going back, not even light has enough speed to escape out of the 
                        gravity well. If you were to make it past the radiation and go deep then you would be spaghettified,
                        this is the actual scientific term. This means that all of your atoms in your body are ripped apart
                        and strung out into a line like spaghetti. Finally, you decend until your atoms become part of the 
                        singularity.
